/**
 * §20.5 — the grounding integration test, against a real temporary code graph.
 *
 * No stubs. A real repository on disk, a real tree-sitter/compiler extraction,
 * real fingerprints, real Markdown, and a real wiki index. The unit tests
 * around `resolveGrounding` decide what a reconciliation *outcome* means; this
 * decides whether the outcomes ever happen, which is a different question and
 * the one a user actually meets.
 *
 * The ten steps the spec lists are each named below. Two of them carry most of
 * the weight:
 *
 * **Step 9** — delete `wiki.db`, rebuild, and drift is still detected. That is
 * the disposability claim with teeth: the canonical reference is in Markdown,
 * so nothing durable was in the index to lose.
 *
 * **Its sibling, which the spec does not number** — mutate the code, *rebuild
 * the graph*, and only then resolve. A graph rebuild re-captures the cached
 * baseline from current code, so anything comparing current-against-cache is
 * comparing current against current and reports `fresh`. This is the failure
 * the whole phase is shaped around, and it is the one test that would go green
 * for the wrong reason if resolution were built the obvious way.
