/**
 * HARD: `mex graph scope` output is byte-identical with the wiki flag off.
 *
 * The plan claimed the existing "protocol-v3 goldens" would prove this. There
 * is no golden corpus — `AGENT_PROTOCOL_VERSION = 3` is real and the guarantee
 * lives in contract tests, not in stored files — so the comparison is built
 * here instead of leaned on (§3c finding 35).
 *
 * What "byte-identical when off" can actually mean, given the flag now exists,
 * is pinned by three claims that together leave nowhere for a change to hide:
 *
 * 1. **The graph does not know the wiki exists.** No module under `src/graph/`
 *    imports `src/wiki/`, so with no provider supplied there is no wiki code to
 *    run, skip, or perturb anything — the flag-off path is the same code it was
 *    before the option was added. This is the structural half and it is checked
 *    against the source.
 * 2. **A provider that returns nothing changes nothing.** Byte-for-byte, every
 *    line, including the summary record whose `truncated` flag is the one field
 *    that could quietly move.
 * 3. **A provider that returns something only ever appends.** The entire
 *    flag-off stream is a prefix of the flag-on stream; no graph record is
 *    reordered, edited or dropped.
