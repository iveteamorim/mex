/**
 * Concurrency, and D10's targets at their real scale.
 *
 * Nothing before P10 touched either. Two separate obligations:
 *
 * ## Concurrency
 *
 * §21 does not name it, but a tool people run from a terminal while an editor
 * extension reads the same scaffold is concurrent whether or not anyone
 * planned for it. Four questions, each with a test: two readers at once; a read
 * during a rebuild; an index published while a reader holds the old file open;
 * and whether a second writer waits or fails.
 *
 * The last one found a real gap. The index has been WAL-mode since P3 with **no
 * `busy_timeout`**, which means a connection that finds the database locked
 * fails immediately with `SQLITE_BUSY` instead of waiting — so any genuine
 * contention surfaced as a hard error rather than a pause. The graph's own
 * opener has set `busy_timeout = 5000` since it was written, with a comment
 * insisting it come first. The wiki now does the same.
 *
 * ## Characterization at D10's scale
 *
 * `perf.test.ts` runs a tenth-scale corpus, while this file can run **5,000
 * entities across 1,000 files**, D10's actual numbers. Timings here are emitted
 * as characterization only. Release budgets are enforced by the pinned Ubuntu
 * benchmark; a shared unit-test worker is not a stable performance environment.
 *
 * The corpus is generated into a temp directory and never committed (finding
 * 50). Deterministic assertions prove the operation and incremental-read
 * contracts; measurements are printed for diagnostics without making the
 * result depend on host speed or scheduler contention.

/**
 * Whether to build D10's full corpus, or a fifth of it.
 *
 * The full 5,000-entity build is ~19s of solid CPU, and adding that to the
 * shared worker pool pushed four unrelated tests past their timeouts and one
 * absolute perf ceiling past its threshold — finding 52.4 happening again, to
 * the phase that quoted it. Making the *other* tests looser to accommodate this
 * one would be exactly the wrong trade.
 *
 * So the default is a fifth of the corpus, which still catches an accidental
 * O(n²) — that is orders of magnitude and visible at any honest scale — and
 * `MEX_WIKI_SCALE=1` runs D10's real numbers. Following P6's precedent for the
 * real-scaffold gate: one **unconditional** test that reads an environment
 * variable, rather than `.skip` or `it.runIf`, both of which move the
 * suite-wide skip count that several gates depend on.
 *
 * The measurements in the handoff are from a full-scale run.
