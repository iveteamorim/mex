/**
 * Synthesis — the in-memory artefacts of §12's pipeline.
 *
 * Nothing here is persisted and nothing here is knowledge. A cluster is a
 * deterministic reading of the repository's own folder layout; a cluster
 * context is that reading plus the source it points at. Both are inputs to a
 * prompt the *agent* runs, and both are thrown away when the run ends.
 *
 * The reader interfaces are declared here rather than imported from the graph
 * door on purpose, the same way the reference implementation declared its own:
 * a narrow interface is what keeps clustering and context extraction testable
 * against object literals, and it is why this pipeline survived being rebound
 * onto a different code graph without a rewrite. `SynthesisGraph` in
 * `grounding/adapter.ts` satisfies both.
