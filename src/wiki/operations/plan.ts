/**
 * §11.3 steps 1–6: envelope in, patch plan out. Nothing here writes a byte.
 *
 * ## The plan is a value, and that is the point
 *
 * It carries the declared ranges, the exact proposed bytes, and the base
 * versions it was built against. That is what lets preview (step 7) and apply
 * (step 8) **disagree** — which they must be able to do, or revalidation is
 * theatre. Apply re-plans against the current tree and compares; a plan that
 * could not be re-derived is a plan that cannot be checked.
 *
 * ## The three checks, and why they are three
 *
 * 1. **Preconditions**, on the normalized entity hash (D6). CRLF and LF
 *    checkouts of one file must agree, or a precondition minted on Windows is
 *    rejected on Linux.
 * 2. **Write scope**, on **raw** bytes, via `applyEdits`. These are different
 *    comparisons and both are required: a scope check against normalized text
 *    passes happily while CRLF line endings get rewritten across a whole file.
 * 3. **The re-parse**, below. Every plan is verified by parsing the text it
 *    produced and asserting that no entity other than the operation's own
 *    subjects changed, compared by content hash. Offsets shift when text is
 *    inserted above them; an entity's *text* does not. So "cannot alter
 *    adjacent entities" — a §11.2 requirement stated separately for
 *    `update-entry`, `add-relation` and the rest — becomes one property checked
 *    the same way for all eleven, rather than eleven tests that each hope.
 *
 *    Compared on {@link neighbourFingerprint} — the entity's text with its
 *    body's *trailing* whitespace trimmed, not the raw content hash. That is
 *    not a loosening; it is the difference between two questions. A body runs
 *    to the start of the next entity's metadata, so **appending an entity at
 *    end of file necessarily extends the previous entity's body range** by the
 *    blank line separating them. Under a raw comparison the most ordinary
 *    operation in the engine — `create-entry` at end-of-file — reports that it
 *    altered an entity it never named, and the check would have to be switched
 *    off for creates, which is where it is needed most. Trailing whitespace at
 *    a body's end is separator, not content: no character of anyone's prose can
 *    change without the fingerprint moving.
 *
 * ## Preconditions are required, not optional
 *
 * §11.1 makes `baseRevision` and `baseContentHash` optional and
 * `checkOperationPreconditions` treats an omitted one as "the caller accepts
 * whatever is on disk". Combined with replay, an unconditional `update-entry`
 * is a loaded gun: it overwrites an edit made between plan and apply, silently,
 * and the audit log records a success. So the pipeline **requires**
 * `baseContentHash` for every operation that mutates an existing entity. A
 * deliberate unconditional write is expressed as `PlanOptions.unconditional`,
 * at the pipeline level rather than in the envelope, because it is a property
 * of the caller's situation and not of the proposal: P6's migration is the real
 * one, planning and applying in one pass with no human in between and no prior
 * revision to name.
