/**
 * Finding the entity an operation is about — **index as hint, filesystem as truth.**
 *
 * §11.3 step 2 says "resolve the target index and source file", and §3.8 of the
 * brief says applying with no `wiki.db` is the normal case rather than an error.
 * Both are true, and together they say something the spec does not: **the index
 * cannot be the authority here.** Nothing in production builds one, so a
 * pipeline that needed one would be a pipeline that never runs; and a stale one
 * is worse than none, because it answers confidently and wrongly.
 *
 * The current-filesystem claimant view deliberately does not consult the index.
 * A caller that has to distinguish one claimant from duplicate ownership must
 * inspect the complete bounded corpus: an index hit can prove that one file used
 * to claim an id, but cannot prove that another current file does not claim it.
 * The answer is therefore identical with a fresh index, a stale index, and no
 * index at all.
 *
 * **The winner rule is shared, not re-derived.** A duplicate id is a state the
 * index is built to hold (finding 31): both claimants are stored and all but
 * `MIN(entity_key)` are flagged `shadowed`. `entity_key` is
 * `<file>#<zero-padded metadata_start>`, so the winner is the earliest position
 * in the earliest path. The filesystem scan orders candidates by the same key,
 * through the same `entityKeyOf`, because a locator that picked a different
 * claimant than the index reports would target the entity the user cannot see.
