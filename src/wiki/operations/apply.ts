/**
 * §11.3 steps 8–11. **The only module under `src/wiki/` that writes Markdown.**
 *
 * Its lint exemption carries a runtime guard, following `dbfile.ts`'s pattern:
 * every mutation goes through {@link assertWritablePath}, which rejects
 * anything that is not a Markdown file (or the temp file about to become one)
 * inside the scaffold root, and fails closed. A lint rule cannot tell that
 * `writeFileSync(p, t)` is safe; the guard can.
 *
 * ## Apply re-plans. It does not replay bytes.
 *
 * The plan carries offsets computed against one parse. Trusting them after a
 * revalidation boundary is exactly the failure `applyEdits`' complement check
 * exists to catch — an edit whose range was computed against a stale parse
 * lands in the wrong place and still produces plausible text. So apply plans
 * again from the current tree and compares:
 *
 * - the **preconditions** must still hold, entity by entity, on the normalized
 *   hash the codec computes;
 * - if the caller supplies a `previewHash`, the whole tree must still be the
 *   one the preview was produced against — that is what an approval binds to.
 *
 * A concurrent edit to an *unrelated* entity in the same file therefore does
 * not block an unbound apply, and is carried through, because the re-plan is
 * built on it. A concurrent edit to the subject does block, as
 * `CONTENT_HASH_CONFLICT`.
 *
 * ## Multi-file operations cannot be atomic, so the question is which bad state
 *
 * There is no two-file rename and rollback code does not run under `SIGKILL`.
 * The constraint (HARD 7) is absolute in one direction only: **a process killed
 * at any point must leave the entity present somewhere.** So files are written
 * **largest gain first** — the file that receives content before the file that
 * loses it. A crash between the two renames leaves a duplicate id, which is a
 * state the index is built to hold and report: both claimants are stored,
 * `DUPLICATE_ENTITY_ID` is emitted, and `MIN(entity_key)` shadows one
 * deterministically. Replaying the `opId` finishes the move. Source-first would
 * leave the entity nowhere, and no probability of that is acceptable.
 *
 * ## The index is a cache and is treated like one
 *
 * If the post-write refresh fails — or there is no `wiki.db` at all, which is
 * the *normal* case, since nothing in production builds one — the result
 * carries `INDEX_REFRESH_REQUIRED` and **the Markdown write stands**. Never
 * undo a valid write because a disposable cache broke, and never rebuild one
 * behind the user's back in the middle of an apply.

 *
 * P6 shipped detection, deterministic rendering and a marker-bounded edit, and
 * left applying it as a stated seam with two candidate homes: a twelfth
 * operation type, or a command. Building it settles the question, because a
 * `WikiPatchPlan` carries a `WikiOperationType` and that field is not
 * decoration — it is what the audit log records and what `acceptedOperations()`
 * reports as having changed this wiki. So the choice is really:
 *
 * - **a twelfth type**, which puts a *rendering* act into the vocabulary of
 *   knowledge changes and makes §11.4's ledger report cosmetic regenerations
 *   alongside the decisions people actually made; or
 * - **a plan carrying one of the eleven**, which is a lie in the audit log; or
 * - **a write that is not an operation.**
 *
 * The third, because a generated section is *derived state*, exactly like
 * `wiki.db`: it contains no knowledge that is not already recorded in the
 * entities it lists, it is re-derivable from the scaffold at any moment, it
 * mints no id, bumps no revision and has no precondition worth taking. There is
 * nothing for replay to protect and nothing for a reviewer to review, so there
 * is no audit line — the audit log is the ledger of knowledge operations, and
 * padding it with regenerations would make the thing it exists to answer harder
 * to read.
 *
 * **It is not a second writer.** The bytes go through `applyEdits`, which
 * verifies that nothing outside the declared range moved, and through
 * `writeAtomically` in this module — the single guarded writer D9 names, with
 * `assertWritablePath` in front of every mutation exactly as before. What is
 * new is a second *caller*, not a second writer.
 *
 * Opt-in at the command line, never a side effect of a read.
