/**
 * The regression oracle — assertions harvested from a reference deployment.
 *
 * These are ported from a working demonstration whose verifier scripts were
 * the acceptance evidence that "the system still works". They are re-derived
 * here as mex's own tests, against mex's own vocabulary, because after this
 * phase that is what they are. Where a harvested check asserted something that
 * is false or meaningless under Markdown-canonical storage, it is recorded in
 * the handoff with its reason rather than silently dropped.
 *
 * Three groups, and the first is the most valuable thing in the set.
 *
 * ## 1. A read never mutates
 *
 * The pattern recurred across four of the source scripts and mex had no
 * equivalent: **the database is byte-identical after every read.** A read that
 * writes is the bug nobody finds — it corrupts under concurrency, it makes two
 * readers disagree, and every individual test still passes because each one
 * reads correctly. Asserting it needs a checksum taken before and after, over
 * every read path there is, which is what this does.
 *
 * ## 2. Grounding integrity
 *
 * No dangling grounding; a grounding is a declaration rather than a module;
 * one baseline row per (entity, node) pair. These are properties of the join
 * §5.1 is built on, and they are what makes code-driven retrieval trustworthy.
 *
 * ## 3. The drift beat
 *
 * One code edit, and exactly the entities that ride on the edited node go
 * stale — no more, no fewer. The source deployment shaped this so that a
 * single edit is provably the whole trigger, which is the part worth keeping:
 * a drift test where several things could have caused the verdict proves
 * nothing about the one that did.
