# [Project Name]

## What This Is
<!-- One sentence. What does this project do?
     Length: 1 sentence maximum.
     Not a tagline — a factual description of what the software does.
     Example: "A REST API for managing inventory across multiple warehouse locations." -->

## Non-Negotiables
<!-- Hard rules the agent must never violate. Not preferences — rules.
     These are the things that, if broken, cause real damage to the codebase.
     Length: 3-7 items maximum. More than 7 means the list has not been prioritised.
     Example:
     - Never write database queries outside of the repository layer
     - Never commit secrets or API keys
     - Always handle errors explicitly — no silent failures -->

## Commands
<!-- The exact commands needed to work on this project.
     Include: run dev server, run tests, run linter, build.
     Use the actual commands from this codebase — not placeholders.
     Example:
     - Dev: `npm run dev`
     - Test: `npm test`
     - Lint: `npm run lint`
     - Build: `npm run build` -->

## Code Graph
Use the smallest relevant structured resolver. For Inbox or Relay mutations, resolve only the intended action with `mex inbox contract --action <command-id> --json` or `mex relay contract --action <command-id> --json`; use `mex capabilities --json` only for broader capability discovery. If the user explicitly asks to create, save, or draft a checkout-local Inbox or Relay draft, preview and apply that exact draft without asking for redundant confirmation. Deleting a local draft, or publishing, approving, rejecting, withdrawing, marking stale, repairing, taking or acknowledging, or closing, requires fresh explicit confirmation after semantic preview. Treat Git commit, push, and pull as separate actions requiring their own authorization.

The repo is indexed into `.mex/graph.db`. Use it to avoid re-reading code you already have — it is one tool alongside Grep/Glob, not a replacement for them.
- If you know the symbol name, go straight to it: `mex graph query <who-calls|what-calls|where-defined> <symbol>` and `mex graph get <id...>` are exact. This is the strongest part of the graph. Each call first proves the whole index is still fresh, so on a large repository it takes seconds: pass several ids to one `graph get` instead of calling it once per id. Give it exact names — an approximate name can return a confident wrong match.
- Exploring an unfamiliar task? `mex graph scope "<task>"` returns bounded, source-backed JSONL context plus trustworthy execution flows. Scope matches on words, not meaning, so treat it as starting evidence rather than a complete answer.
- Treat source returned by the graph as ALREADY READ; do not re-open those files.
- Read the summary status and evidence. `status: "ok"` remains usable when `truncated: true`; only optional evidence was omitted. For `partial` or `degraded`, narrow the task or follow `suggestedNextCommands`.
- Use `mex graph get <id> --detail source` only when source is missing, you need exact expansion, or a partial/degraded summary suggests it. Do not expand nodes by quota.
- If the evidence is insufficient or the task wording does not match the code, use Grep/Glob instead. Do not re-run `scope` with reworded phrasing more than once.
- Before editing a symbol, run `mex impact <symbol|file>` to see affected callers and scaffold memory.
- During `mex sync`, adjudicate any AMBIGUOUS grounding; after repairs, ensure the refreshed grounding is re-emitted.

## After Every Task
After meaningful work, run GROW:
- Ground: what changed in reality?
- Record: update `.mex/ROUTER.md` and relevant `.mex/context/` files
- Orient: create or update a `.mex/patterns/` runbook if this can recur
- Write: bump `last_updated` on changed scaffold files; optional `mex log` notes follow the logging policy below

## Agent Logging
Read `mex logging --json` at session start and before optional logging. This checkout-local advisory preference is `significant` (quiet default: material decisions, risks, blockers, or durable discoveries), `checkpoints` (batch useful notes at task/session boundaries), or `manual` (no unsolicited notes). Skip routine tool calls, edits, repeated status, and empty summaries. Honor explicit user log requests in every mode; never suppress mandatory workflow Activity or recovery audit records. Report a policy read failure instead of guessing or changing the preference.

When earlier work may inform the task, use `mex timeline --query "subject phrase" --file src/example.ts --limit 10 --json` with a known subject or exact recorded file path, or both. These are historical notes, not accepted current knowledge. Verify conclusions before reuse or explicit promotion with their source retained.

## Navigation
At the start of every session, read `.mex/ROUTER.md` before doing anything else.
For full project context, patterns, and task guidance — everything is there.
